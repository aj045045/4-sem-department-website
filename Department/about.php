            <p>Department of Computer Science, Gujarat University is the most popular, well sought and best resourced
                Computer Science
                Department in Gujarat. Ever since its inception, Department of Computer Science has maintained and
                sustained
                its legacy
                as a premium institute in providing high quality education to produce personnel with professional and
                personal success
                as well as high ethics and social conduct. The resources at the department are well supported by
                extensive
                networked
                Computer facilities and software aids well along with skilled and experienced faculties. A pioneer
                institute
                in initiating
                and successfully running MCA and PGDCSA since 1982, the Department initiated M.Tech.(Networking and
                Administration) ,
                M.Tech.(Web Technologies) and PGDNA in 2010. The aim of initiating these programs is to produce
                professionals ready to meet
                the current market needs as well as skilled in research capabilities. Understanding that Intelligent
                Computing is the future
                of computing, the department initiated yet another post graduate course in Intelligent Computing. The
                course
                M.Sc.
                (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning) aims to provide M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence and
                Machine Learning.
                This program offers a solid awareness of the key concepts of Artificial Intelligence. The students would
                be
                able to develop
                strong basis of machine learning and data mining. The students would have best career prospects in
                scientific, business and
                financial sectors. Further to leverage the versatile system to train Computer professionals department
                has
                started 5 Year
                Integrated M. Sc. (Computer Science) in 2021. To promote and facilitate research in Computer Science and
                other interdisciplinary
                subjects, Department offers doctoral courses like Ph.D. (Computer science) under well-experienced
                guides.
                The Department also
                takes the responsibility to the fullest of training the educators. It has organized in recent past UGC
                short
                courses and
                international workshops imparting theoretical and practical training to various colleges and
                universities
                teachers at state level and national level.</p>
